# TDEE Calculator

Simple TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculator that uses **Mifflin-St Jeor equation** to calculate BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and then uses **Katch-McArdle multipliers** to calculate TDEE.

It also provides suggested amount of calories based on selected goal:
- "Cut" (lose fat): TDEE x 0.8
- "Lean Bulk" (build lean muscle): TDEE x 1.1
- "Maintain" (maintain the same weight): TDEE
